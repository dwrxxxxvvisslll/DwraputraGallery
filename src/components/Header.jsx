      Hello! <br />
      I'm Dwraputra <br />
    </h1>
    <p className="text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed max-w-md">
    A wanderer with a camera — chasing light, chasing stories. My name
            is Wiradana Putra, but in the world of frames and focus, I go by
            Dwraputra. I find beauty in fleeting glances, quiet streets, and the
            loud silence of a wedding vow. I shoot weddings — where love speaks
            in smiles, tears, and the way two hands hold. I shoot the streets —
            where real life spills out in colors, chaos, and rhythm.
            Photography, for me, isn’t about perfection. It’s about honesty. A
            split-second truth, frozen in time. This website is a gallery of
            what I’ve seen, felt, and lived — not just with my eyes, but with
            heart. Take a stroll. Let the frames speak. And if they whisper to
            your soul, let’s make magic together.
